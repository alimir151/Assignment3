        <li><h3>Programmed a Game Board using Python</h3>
            <br>
            The project creates a game board for scoring dice rolls using Python. The game board allows players to roll a set of dice and receive a score based on the numbers they roll.

            The game board layout includes a roll button, a dice display, and a score display. When the player clicks the roll button, the program generates random numbers (dice rolls) and displays them in the dice display section of the game board. The program then calculates the score based on the numbers rolled and displays the score in the score display section of the game board.

            The scoring system can vary based on the rules of the game. For example, players may be awarded points for rolling certain numbers, or for rolling a specific combination of numbers. The program can be customized to reflect the rules of any particular game.

            Overall, this project is a fun and interactive way to practice coding in Python while also creating a game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
